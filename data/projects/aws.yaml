The application landscape consisted of various virtual machines running Java applications and load balancer / proxies. Additionally, a Kubernetes was in place for the new mircoservice architecture. In the context of the migration I was responsible for the reproducible implemetation of the application's infrastructure within AWS (Infrastructure as Code) including EC2s configured by Ansible, RDS, ALB/NLB, EKS, security groups and more. Furthermore, I supported the team in troubleshooting any infrastructure related issues like network connectivity. <p class="technologies">AWS, Terraform, Ansbile, CentOS, Python, HAProxy, Nginx</p>
