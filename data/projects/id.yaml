description: As a shared resource and interface to infrastructure in multiple agile product teams I was responsible for the infrastructure support and CI/CD. Despite different team requirements my focus was to simplify and standardize the CI/CD process. I was responsible for the automated build of artifacts and their deployment in Kubernetes in different environments in close cooperation with the developers and the infrastructure team. I implemented monitoring and supported in troubleshooting of deployments and application failures. For election days I was in charge to ensure that involved IT systems resist the traffic peaks. <p class="technologies">Kubernetes, Docker, AWS, Gitlab-CI, Kustomize, Quarkus, Node.js</p>
